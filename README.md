# InSAR Time-series assessment 

## This repo will provide:
 1. a guide for InSAR (Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) processing using JPL's ISCE-2 software and Miami University's Mintpy packages.
 2. possible origin of errors and their mitigation when using ISCE-2 and mintpy. 
 3. bash scripts to automate ISCE-2 processing 
 4. Python-based ways to explore and visualise InSAR datasets - using xarrays. 
 5. Possible ways to use InSAR analysis to increase the understanding of earth surface processes.
